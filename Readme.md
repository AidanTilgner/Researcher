This is effectively a placeholder repository for the "Researcher Project"

Basically, I really love perplexity, and other tools. However, I don't really wanna spend money on perplexity or other tools, so I figured I'd make something which can compile research reports at will. It's essentially gonna be a scriptier version of perplexity or other search tools.

Some initial thoughts:
- The user can input a prompt, and the system will generate a report based on it
- The report will be pretty and nicely designed

- There will be types of reports
